Jenkins --
===========

Open source Continous Integration tool.
Jenkins will build and deploy the application committed to Git/BitBucket using several plugins
such as Docker, Maven, Git, Pipeline etc.
For Continous integration, continous delivery, continous deployment by integrating with other tools

Docker --
==========
We need to know what is Virtualization and Containerisation.
The goal of these two is to solve the problem of my code works on my machine and not on your machine.
Example is some where in the line the code which works on windows may not run on production unix system due to few unsupporting libraries.
Virtualization : Here every application runs on virtual machine, since it gets a guests OS on a host OS.
Draw back is while running multiple virtual machines on same OS (host). This will degrade the performance of the system.
Since each virtual machine will make use of hosts memory for each of the tools that it uses. It takes time to boot up also.

To over come this problem, Containerization was introduced.
Containerization : Here the application uses the host OS itslef and not virtual machine. Each container will have a application with set of its libraries.
Docker is containerization tool which manages different applications which run on different (Docker) containers.
Docker file contains the code which defines the application dependencies and requirements.
Through this Docker file the container generates/produces Docker image which contains dependencies such as libraries and packages
of the application. This docker image runs as a docker container.
Docker container is a runtime instance of a docker image.
